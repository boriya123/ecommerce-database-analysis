### Acknowledgement: 
This comprehensive course not only provided a great hands-on experience in practicing SQL, also helped me solidify certain digital marketing domain knowledge gained with a local bootcamp and enhance my understanding of performance measurement in the digital and ecommerce field. The original database and ERD are owned by the instructor which are not publicly available here.
