# ECommerce Startup Database Analysis 

This repository consists of some of the hands-on assignment and project questions I’ve done by following an advanced online SQL course. By exploring the database and **writing multi-step SQL queries to work on real-world eCommerce use cases**, I’ve improved MySQL Workbench Skills, gained a deeper understanding of leveraging SQL to conduct data and performance analytics, and solidified some digital marketing domain knowledge.
